Coding Challenge Quiz!
============

	I have created a multiple choice quiz with 5 questions total which is based on basic coding knowlege and scores based on a timer which begins at 75 seconds and can be seen in the top-right corner of your screen. 
	Final score is based on how fast you can answer and finish the quiz. Incorrect answers will have a penalty by deducting 10 seconds from the remaining timer. If the timer runs out before you answer all the questions you lose.
	A text will appear letting you know the result as "correct" or "wrong" when answering each questions.
	At the end of the quiz you will be asked to enter your name in the text field and submit it which will save your score and name to localStorage and can be seen on the highscores page.
